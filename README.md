# Deep Learning in Statistical Genetics Summer Course

## Overview
I learned about neural networks and pytorch and used those skills to use models to find relations between genes and phenotypes.

This [blog page](https://lvairus.github.io/deep-learning-summer-2023/) contains my documentations of my learning, tutorials, and projects.

## Projects:

I developed analytical tools to compare different tensor outputs of the [Enformer](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41592-021-01252-x) model. 

Planned and started execution of precomputing the whole genome through Enformer and save the results into hdf5 files so that we could index the Enformer results rather than predict them, which takes much longer and is more computationally expensive.
